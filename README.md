# graphql-typegen-testing

Test project for [GraphQL TypeScript Generation RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35420).

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` / `yarn`
1. Start the development server with `npm run develop` / `yarn develop`
1. Follow the instructions on the index page at `localhost:8000`

## Questions

- How would you compare this process to the way youâ€™ve used GraphQL query results historically with your Gatsby sites?
- Rate the DX from 1 (awful) to 5 (best ever)

## Help
